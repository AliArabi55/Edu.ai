## 🎪 Key Technical Recommendations

### 🔍 RAG vs Fine-tuning Strategy

**Recommendation:** Use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with Azure AI Search instead of fine-tuning[^2]

**Benefits:**

- **Cost-effective:** RAG is significantly cheaper than fine-tuning (\$1.70 per million tokens)[^3]
- **Flexible:** Real-time content updates without retraining
- **Transparent:** Clear source attribution for educational content
- **Maintainable:** Easy content base updates


### 🎭 Avatar Strategy

**Recommendation:** Start with prebuilt avatars, upgrade to custom later[^4]

**Rationale:**

- Custom avatar training: \$600-1400 (one-time)
- Custom avatar hosting: \$430+ monthly per model[^5]
- Prebuilt avatars sufficient for MVP
- Can upgrade based on user feedback
