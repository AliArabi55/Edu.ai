## 🎪 Key Technical Recommendations

### 🔍 RAG vs Fine-tuning Strategy

**Recommendation:** Use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with Azure AI Search instead of fine-tuning[^2]

**Benefits:**

- **Cost-effective:** RAG is significantly cheaper than fine-tuning (\$1.70 per million tokens)[^3]
- **Flexible:** Real-time content updates without retraining
- **Transparent:** Clear source attribution for educational content
- **Maintainable:** Easy content base updates
